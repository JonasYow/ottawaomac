## Youth Pastor: Rev. Joshua Kahle
### Email: josh@eastgatealliance.ca
### Phone: +1 (613) 744-0682
Josh was born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario, into a large family — he has nine siblings, and they are all from the same two parents! Along with his siblings, Josh has grown up and attended East Gate since he was a wee baby. During his high school years, alongside a few other members of the youth group, he had an opportunity to take part in a 10-day mission trip to Mexico City, and while there, he felt God was really pressing on his heart to enter into ministry. Upon returning from that trip, and with much prayer and wrestling, he decided to accept God’s call, and in 2010, he was enrolled at Tyndale University College and Seminary.

Much to his surprise, after graduating in 2015 with a B.A. in Biblical Studies and Theology, God opened the door for Josh to come back to East Gate to serve as our Youth Pastor. Josh has a passion to see our youth not only come to know Jesus Christ personally as their Lord and Savior, but to walk and grow deeper in their relationship with Him over the course of their lives and in turn, make Him known to others as well!

Josh is a huge soccer fan and is competitive in everything from sports to staring contests. In 2012, he married his wife Stephanie, whom he had met and grown up with during his years attending our church’s youth group. Together, in March 2016, they had their first child, Elianna, who is the pride and joy of their lives.

## Children Pastor: Debbie Macphail
### Email: debbie@eastgatealliance.ca
### Phone: +1 (613) 744-0682
Debbie has been on staff at East Gate Alliance since 2007 as the Director of Children and Family Ministries. She oversees the children and family ministries for both East Gate and the Ottawa Mandarin Alliance Church, and feels that joint ministry is a blessing! She enjoys serving and working alongside the families and volunteers from both congregations.

Debbie previously worked for 16 years with the Ottawa Carleton District School Board as an Educational Assistant for children with special needs. In 2006, Debbie felt God calling her into ministry, and over the next two years she transitioned from the education sector into children’s ministry. She completed an online program through Valley Forge Christian College, and obtained a Children’s Ministry Certificate.

Debbie has always had a passion and love for children, and desires to see families be units within which Christ is modeled and taught. She sees churches and families working together for one purpose — to raise up children to know and love Christ.
